The written section for our track, for example, was explained to test you on the class you had taken from each of the track's ""principal areas"" (since you have to take at least one from each). When I received my test, I found that the exam question I had received, was in fact, from a class I had not taken.

Some peers have complained of being paid in a mixture of 1099's and W-2's that make tax withholding inconsistent and difficult. Also due to this mixture, very few incoming students know how to classify their income for taxes. While the Graduate School has fortunately started an annual seminar about this, it's still non-trivial for students. Related is the Graduate School's recent cuts to recreation facility memberships for senior graduate students. While this was not a CEE policy and CEE fortunately extended the benefit (for one year anyway), it certainly decreases our satisfaction of working as a graduate student here when popular benefits

For the past several years, it has been a nightmare. As a PhD student, adviser supported me with tuition and stipend for the first four years. However, basically nothing related to the research or personal development was provided. It is even hard to have a chance to communicate my research with my adviser. For a very limited times that I have the chances to meet my adviser personally, he was impatient and didn't want to spend time to discuss. Similar situations happened to other students in our group.  This led me to think about the student-adviser relationship in our department. As a student, we don't have much choice. We want to earn our degree and we need certain financial support as we cannot afford the cost for the whole PhD program. To change adviser is one option, but it is always complicated since there are not many choices in our department. On the other hand, there seems no penalty towards a faculty who did not do a good job on advising students. What is more important, the adviser has too much power on a studentâ€™s development. A â€˜Noâ€™ from adviser means 100% fail for a PhD student no matter what other committee members think about the student. The choice of adviser then became essentially important for a PhD student. We need not only to know their research, but also need to know their personality, which is basically impossible before a student join a research group. This should not be the case. I would suggest our department to either has ways to motivate faculties to pay more attention on advising student or limit adviserâ€™s power.

Otherwise, it doesn't get the time and attention necessary to be useful. I think this portion of the QEs should actually just be the prelims - done a year after the QE. Qualifying exams are not particularly relevant for students conducting highly interdisciplinary work. Seems bizarre to invest 2 years in cookie-cutter engineering classes (even if students took similar classes as undergrads) just to pass a test and never use most of the information again; it felt like a lot of wasted time. Then again, a handful of coursework covered by the QE was very helpful, and I am not sure how students would adequately determine which courses were most useful ahead of time. Maybe by meeting with their advisors?

As previously mentioned, more flexibility in coursework based on direction of intended research. Right now, it appears that we have more flexibility than we really do, as the QE covers specific coursework, and no one feel comfortable opting not to take any of those classes, even they have already taken a similar class or the class has no relevance to their intended research area. 3.
